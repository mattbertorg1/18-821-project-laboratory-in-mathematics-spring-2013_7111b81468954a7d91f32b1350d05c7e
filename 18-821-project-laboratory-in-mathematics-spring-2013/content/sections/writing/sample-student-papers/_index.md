To illustrate the writing and revision process for the student papers, two sample projects are presented below.

Sample Paper 1: The Dynamics of Successive Differences Over ℤ and ℝ
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This project developed from the project description for [Number Squares (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/mathematical-work/mit18_821s13_pjct_num_sq). To view the practice presentation and final presentation from this team of students, see the [Sample Student Presentations]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/presentations) page.

### Debriefing for First Draft of Sample Paper 1

{{< youtube imIVOrUkNJE >}}

This video features the debriefing meeting for the first draft of Sample Paper 1. The student team first presents their findings, and then the course instructors offer feedback and discuss the mathematics and the writing for the project.

Sample Paper 2: Tossing a Coin
